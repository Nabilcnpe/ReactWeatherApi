This project was bootstrapped with Create React APP.

It's a weather web application.

Un API is used to get the current weather in every city in the world.

If when starting the APP you got this message : `Cannot read property 'thisCompilation' of undefined`, please delete node_modules directory & package-lock and make a `npm install` then restart the APP with `npm start` :)
